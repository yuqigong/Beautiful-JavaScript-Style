#### The Guides (in no particular order)

:link: **「[idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js)」**, Principles of Writing Consistent, Idiomatic JavaScript.

:link: **「[Google JavaScript Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml)」**, Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions (sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style.

:link: **「[JavaScript Style Guides And Beautifiers - By Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/blog/javascript-style-guides-and-beautifiers/)」**, A style guide or style manual is a set of standards for the writing and design of code. The implementation of a style guide provides uniformity in code style and formatting, often covering guidelines regarding indentation (tabs vs. spaces), variable and function naming conventions, where best to apply whitespace and so on.

:link: **「[JavaScript Style Guide - jQuery](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)」**,  jQuery core code style guide.

:link: **「[ROS JavaScript Style Guide](http://wiki.ros.org/JavaScriptStyleGuide)」**, This page defines a style guide to be followed in writing JavaScript code for ROS. This guide applies to all ROS code, both core and non-core. It is based on [Google's Javascript Style Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml) and best practices from the early development of [roslibjs](http://wiki.ros.org/roslibjs) and [Robot Web Tools](http://www.robotwebtools.org/).

:link: **「[Front-end Code Standards & Best Practices - Javascript Part](http://isobar-idev.github.io/code-standards/#_javascript)」**, This document's primary motivation is two- fold: 1) code consistency and 2) best practices. By maintaining consistency in coding styles and conventions, we can ease the burden of legacy code maintenance, and mitigate risk of breakage in the future. By adhering to best practices, we ensure optimized page loading, performance and maintainable code.

:link: **「[Frontend Guidelines - Javascript Part](https://github.com/bendc/frontend-guidelines#javascript)」**, [frontend-guidelines](https://github.com/bendc/frontend-guidelines) is a project shows some HTML, CSS and JS best practices.

:link: **「[Code Conventions for the JavaScript Programming Language](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html)」**, This is a set of coding conventions and rules for use in JavaScript programming. It is inspired by the Sun document Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language. It is heavily modified of course because JavaScript is not Java.

:link: **「[AngularJS Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide)」**, AngularJS Style Guide: A starting point for AngularJS development teams to provide consistency through good practices.

:link: **「[Felix's Node.js Style Guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide)」**, A guide for styling your node.js / JavaScript code. Fork & adjust to your taste.
